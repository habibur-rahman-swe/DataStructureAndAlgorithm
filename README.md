# Data Structure and Algorithm Notes

## What is Big O?

- `Big O` is the language and metric we use to describe the `efficiency of algorithms`
- `Time Complexity` : measure the number of operation
- `Space Complexity`: measure the amount of memory used

## Big O Notations

- Best case(`Omega -> Ω`)
- Average case(`Theta -> θ`)
- Worst case(`Big O -> O`)

## Runtime Complexities

| Complexity | Name        | Sample                          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | Constant    | A simple add numbers function   |
| O(N)       | Linear      | Loop through number from 1 to n |
| O(LogN)    | Logarithmic | Find an element in sorted array |
| O(N^2)     | Quadratic   | Nested Loops                    |
